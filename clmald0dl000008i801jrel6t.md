## IAM Programmatic access

In order to access your AWS account from a terminal or system, you can use AWS Access keys and AWS Secret Access keys.

## AWS CLI

The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

The AWS CLI v2 offers several new features including improved installers, new configuration options such as AWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS SSO), and various interactive features.

## Task-01

* **Create AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID and AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY from AWS Console.**
    

Log in to your AWS Management Console.

Click on your username in the top right corner of the console and select "Security Credentials" from the drop-down menu.
